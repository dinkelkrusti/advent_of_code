# advent_of_code
Saving my noob rust code for AOC here, since I can not be trusted around my local file system.

See https://adventofcode.com/

Input files included in resource folder, not sure whether the inputs are generated on a user-to-user basis tho. However the fact that they are included in the repo allows anyone that downloads it to run the tests in lib.rs
